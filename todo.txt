
- make deeper build refactoring
    - try to resolve in-copmpile blackbox hacks
        - fix bsetroot requires static in-compilation of bimage.cpp
            * move sources to src folder
            * move configs in root, styles, etc to data folder
            * check all compiles and generates successfully
            * add same defines to bbcore lib as in blackbox proj
            * create g test especially for bbcore lib
            * move blackbox entry to separate main.cpp file
                * make a file
                * make a class Blackbox
                * make call of Blackbox class to run
                * move winmain to main.cpp
            - move content of blackbox to bbcore lib
                * make a list of exported bbapi
                x create 'storage' file for bbapi replacement in bbcore (bbcoreapi)
                * make compilation of bblib fully separate from blackbox
                ? cannot directly move all to bbcore - impossible to used both libs by consumers together - doubled content
                    - move all files and put all content to namespaces (except: main.cpp, bbapi xx)
                        * resolve bblib includes dir and headers from blackbox dir (bbapi.h)
                            * move bblib from c to cpp
                                * fix bblib: pidl.c uses defaultrcPath() from blackbox proj
                                * remove include of blackbox headers to bblib
                        * fix the .\blackbox\Settings.h variables containment
                        * fix the exported api's from blackbox that contain ellipsis - blocks moving to namespace
                        * fix missing va_end paired to va_start (or leads to #UB)
                        * resolve code duplication in blackbox of exported api's and tools (and names collisions)
                        ? the BBSETTING_STYLEREADER_ONLY in settins.cpp prevents from normal moving to namespace
                            ? bbrcPath cannot find from settings.cpp when in-compile hack
                                ? it cannot be resolved in case of in-compile of settings.cpp because needed bbrcPath() is not compiled in that case
                            ? the __BBCORE__ macro in settings.cpp prevents clean move out api
                    ? make wrapper calls for every exported blackbox api
                    - make callable functions with moved original content from exported api in bbcore lib
            - make separate static only lib bbcore with namespace bbcore inside, no exports
                ? __BBCORE__ prevents from splitting
                    ? uses __BBCORE__ strange files:
                        ? bb.h contains extern globals under this macro . But separate functions for blackbox case compilation
                        ? bbapi.cpp (no one uses except blackbox)
                        ? fix bbapi.cpp (no one uses except blackbox)
                        ? settings.cpp (used by bbnote, bbstylemaker) ; changes func behaviour
                            ? resolve __BBCORE__ in settings.cpp

                        - bbsenddata.h (if macro and x64 changes func behaviour)
                        - utils.cpp (adds print log fn)
            - move blackbox to use bbcore lib
            - move all blackbox functionality to bbcore lib
            - replace direct in-compile of cpp from ex blackbox in bsetroot to usage of static lib bbcore
            - try remove direct in-compile of image_cx.cpp
            ? needs functions bimage_init bimage_create bimage_destroy bimage_getpixels
                ? try move bimage functions to bblib
                    ? bimage uses global static variables
                        - try remove bimage global variables
            ? bbstylemaker requires in-compile Settings.cpp, BImage.cpp
                ? stylemaker defines it's macro BBSETTING_STYLEREADER_ONLY and causes compilation different code in Settings.cpp
                ? requires functions parse_font, ReadStyle, GetStyleItems, StyleStructPtr
            ? bbnote requres in-compile sources: Settings.cpp, BImage.cpp
                ? adds macroses BBSETTING_STYLEREADER_ONLY BBSETTING_NOWINDOW that changes compiled code
                ? missing in-compile functions: bimage_init, ReadStyle
                - BImage.cpp ; ?  
        - resolve: exports in original are exported from exe and plugins use it
            - cover bblib exported api with tests
            ? make possible compilation of bbcore as static and as dynamic lib
        - remove hack in bbnote - in-compile sources from other dir
        - remove hack compilations of:

                - make compilation
                    - error: undefined symbol: bbWC2MB in pidl.c (located in blackbox)
                        - move bbWC2MB,bbWC2MB to strings.c and exported with usage and forwarding export in blackbox
                            * create helper wchar string convertin func in bblib
                            ? pidl uses bbWC2MB that depends on flag
                            ? the bbWC2MB depends on property Settings_UTF8Encoding in blackbox
                            - make tests for wchar_to_mbs
                    - undefined symbol: defaultrcPath in pidl.c (located in blackbox)

    - try to replace usage of bbMB2WC to explicit case by existing callers to utf-8 or wchar_t
    - replace callings of MessageBeep to something. Maybe window flashing
      once. It is a bad practice to cause any sounds
    * make sure every used va_start paired with closing va_end
    ? in class Menu remove friends function. Must not access to fields from outside

? change structure - source + include dirs for plugins
- move to wchar_t paths usage (inside)
? fix shared build of bblib
? bblean skin plugin don't work without loaded bblean bar !
? possibly calling 'about' corrupts string due to conversion from utf-8
- fix about text (encoding currupted) show in: bsetbg, bsetroot

- make external utf-8 only in char* args
- make windows 10, 11 full support - hook mode and native

  developement
- figure out how generated fonts used and how can be used
- modify default styles to show user's windows wallpaper
    - test style with wallpaper engine
- replace explicit imports for functions that present at least from vista/xp

    ? update CXIMAGE version ?
    - remove explicit definitions WIN64 and _WIN64
    - move copy artifacts function to one common upper level cmake file and use by subprojects
    - figure out: maybe usage of read_file causes horribly memory leaks
    - make incremental adding compiled plugins to config ini
    - in bbroot.h remove statics
    ? uwp gui-based windows case ?
    ? add changelog file ?
    - possibly nls2b potentially overflows buffer
    - rewrite nls usage to use c++ hash map internally

- add manifest to make winapi dialogs look more pretty

- rewrite paths.cpp from win-specific apis to c++ filesystem

bugs to fix:
-----------
- correct work under windows 10
- correct work under windows 11
- correct work 'as shell' under windows 10
- correct work 'as shell' under windows 11
- oni.exe game does not run via menu under windows 10 x64

features request:
----------------
- work with Wallpaper Engine app
- xoblite_bb5_rc4 plugins compatibility
- custom control panel app - 'restoring' classic one
- make app for fast replacement of old windows photo viewer (rundll32 "%ProgramFiles%\Windows Photo Viewer\PhotoViewer.dll")
- make bbnote support utf-8 and display as utf-8 by default
