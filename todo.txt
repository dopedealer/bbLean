      once. It is a bad practice to cause any sounds
    * make sure every used va_start paired with closing va_end
    ? in class Menu remove friends function. Must not access to fields from outside
    - remove cringe memset hacks in: 
        - Menu::Menu(const char *pszTitle)

    - make incremental adding compiled plugins to config ini
    - in bbroot.h remove statics
    ? uwp gui-based windows case ?
    ? add changelog file ?
    - possibly nls2b potentially overflows buffer
    - rewrite nls usage to use c++ hash map internally
    - move nls from outside of bbcore namespace - possibly in bblib to separate independent class (free of global variables, states, functions, ...)
    ? the findRCFile usage with writing to output buffer is overflow vulnerable
    - change bad unchecked buffer size writing in bbPath, bbcore::findRCFile

    - fix the Core_IDString - it copies to output buffer without border check
    - replace all sprintf cases - printint to buffer without checking size is dangerous
    - think something about Menu class related g_incref, g_decref functions -
      may be public? Methods instead of global functions ?
    - remove all static variables from class Menu (at least g_MenuWindowList_, g_MenuStructList, g_MenuRefList)
    - rewrite implicit import mechanisms (probably replace to my lib loader usage)
    - move all export methods from blackbox.h to specific subsystem classes.
      Make composition of methods instead of calling of something in bbcore.
    - make bbcore::makeGradient function parameters passed as struct instead of large number of pars
    - move all functions that ends with XXX_command to corresponding source fiels (commands.cpp, commands.h)
