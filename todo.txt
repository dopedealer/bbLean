        ? bsetroot requires static in-compilation of bimage.cpp
            ? needs functions bimage_init bimage_create bimage_destroy bimage_getpixels
                ? try move bimage functions to bblib
                    ? bimage uses global static variables
                        - try remove bimage global variables
            ? bbstylemaker requires in-compile Settings.cpp, BImage.cpp
                ? stylemaker defines it's macro BBSETTING_STYLEREADER_ONLY and causes compilation different code in Settings.cpp
                ? requires functions parse_font, ReadStyle, GetStyleItems, StyleStructPtr
            ? bbnote requres in-compile sources: Settings.cpp, BImage.cpp
                ? adds macroses BBSETTING_STYLEREADER_ONLY BBSETTING_NOWINDOW that changes compiled code
                ? missing in-compile functions: bimage_init, ReadStyle
        - resolve: exports in original are exported from exe and plugins use it
            - cover bblib exported api with tests
            ? make possible compilation of bbcore as static and as dynamic lib
        - remove hack in bbnote - in-compile sources from other dir
        - remove hack compilations of:
            - cpp files from bbstylemaker
            - in bbLeanSkinEng remove direct in-compile hack of ../../blackbox/BImage.cpp !!!
            - remove direct cpp file include from:
                - bbleanBar
            - make bblib buildable as dynamic based on option
                - make compilation
                    - error: undefined symbol: bbWC2MB in pidl.c (located in blackbox)
                        - move bbWC2MB,bbWC2MB to strings.c and exported with usage and forwarding export in blackbox
                            * create helper wchar string convertin func in bblib
                            ? pidl uses bbWC2MB that depends on flag
                            ? the bbWC2MB depends on property Settings_UTF8Encoding in blackbox
                            - make tests for wchar_to_mbs
                    - undefined symbol: defaultrcPath in pidl.c (located in blackbox)
        - make sure needed defs defined based on option
        - set correct artifacts gaterhing to instaler build
        - remove global variable in rc functionality 

? remove __BBCORE__ macro usage in blackbox.exe
