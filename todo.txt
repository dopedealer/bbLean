    ? in class Menu remove friends function. Must not access to fields from outside
    - remove cringe memset hacks in: 
        - Menu::Menu(const char *pszTitle)
        - MenuItem::MenuItem(const char* pszTitle) 
        - plugin_info()
        - all callers of BBP_clear

? change structure - source + include dirs for plugins
- move to wchar_t paths usage (inside)
? fix shared build of bblib
? bblean skin plugin don't work without loaded bblean bar !
? possibly calling 'about' corrupts string due to conversion from utf-8
- fix about text (encoding currupted) show in: bsetbg, bsetroot

- make export functions commented in doxygen style
? rename bbLeanSkinEng32 to correct one ('english' ? 32 bits?)
- find how 'exactly' works read_value - 'reading' with returning pointer to
  string is *very* suspicious. Hashmap? When cleared ?
- move bbPath() function and corresponding path-related to rcfile area
- remove all 'include cpp' hacks everywhere

- move bblib c files to cpp with careful export conventions
- make external utf-8 only in char* args
- make windows 10, 11 full support - hook mode and native
? add spleen font type usage from openbsd

    - figure out: maybe usage of read_file causes horribly memory leaks
    - make incremental adding compiled plugins to config ini
    - in bbroot.h remove statics
    ? uwp gui-based windows case ?
    ? add changelog file ?
    - possibly nls2b potentially overflows buffer
    - rewrite nls usage to use c++ hash map internally
    - move nls from outside of bbcore namespace - possibly in bblib to separate independent class (free of global variables, states, functions, ...)
    ? the findRCFile usage with writing to output buffer is overflow vulnerable
    - change bad unchecked buffer size writing in bbPath, bbcore::findRCFile
    - move functions code from BBSendData.h to related cpp  file
    - remove global usage of SettingsXXX classes (SettingsCommon, etc)
    - remove warnings on msvsc compilation, mingw

    - remove friends everywhere.
    - remove bbnote Menu_Reconfigure - replace somehow with bbcore functionality - remove duplication (bbcore - bbnote)
    - fix the Core_IDString - it copies to output buffer without border check
    - replace all sprintf cases - printint to buffer without checking size is dangerous
    - think something about Menu class related g_incref, g_decref functions -
      may be public? Methods instead of global functions ?
    - remove all static variables from class Menu (at least g_MenuWindowList_, g_MenuStructList, g_MenuRefList)
    - rewrite implicit import mechanisms (probably replace to my lib loader usage)
    - move all export methods from blackbox.h to specific subsystem classes.
      Make composition of methods instead of calling of something in bbcore.
    - make bbcore::makeGradient function parameters passed as struct instead of large number of pars
    - move all functions that ends with XXX_command to corresponding source fiels (commands.cpp, commands.h)


- add manifest to make winapi dialogs look more pretty
- add 'start button', then workspaces. Maybe similar to awesome wm
- try to use bbzero plugins

- rewrite paths.cpp from win-specific apis to c++ filesystem
