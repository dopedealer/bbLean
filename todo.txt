            - try remove in-compiles
            - replace direct in-compile of cpp from ex blackbox in bsetroot to usage of static lib bbcore
            - try remove direct in-compile of image_cx.cpp
            ? needs functions bimage_init bimage_create bimage_destroy bimage_getpixels
                ? try move bimage functions to bblib
                    ? bimage uses global static variables
                        - try remove bimage global variables
            ? bbstylemaker requires in-compile Settings.cpp, BImage.cpp
                ? stylemaker defines it's macro BBSETTING_STYLEREADER_ONLY and causes compilation different code in Settings.cpp
                ? requires functions parse_font, ReadStyle, GetStyleItems, StyleStructPtr
            ? bbnote requres in-compile sources: Settings.cpp, BImage.cpp
                ? adds macroses BBSETTING_STYLEREADER_ONLY BBSETTING_NOWINDOW that changes compiled code
                ? missing in-compile functions: bimage_init, ReadStyle
                - BImage.cpp ; ?  
        - resolve: exports in original are exported from exe and plugins use it
            - cover bblib exported api with tests
            ? make possible compilation of bbcore as static and as dynamic lib
        - remove hack in bbnote - in-compile sources from other dir
        - remove hack compilations of:

                        - move bbWC2MB,bbWC2MB to strings.c and exported with usage and forwarding export in blackbox
                            * create helper wchar string convertin func in bblib
                            ? pidl uses bbWC2MB that depends on flag
                            ? the bbWC2MB depends on property Settings_UTF8Encoding in blackbox
                            - make tests for wchar_to_mbs
                    - undefined symbol: defaultrcPath in pidl.c (located in blackbox)
